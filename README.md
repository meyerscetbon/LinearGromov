# Linear-Time Gromov Wasserstein Distances using Low Rank Couplings and Costs
Code of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01128.pdf) by Meyer Scetbon, Gabriel Peyr√© and Marco Cuturi.

In this [file](https://github.com/meyerscetbon/LinearGromov/blob/main/toy_examples.py) we provide some toy examples where we compare the Entropic GW cost with our proposed scheme.
